Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems (Illinois HEALS) is a multi-year initiative to address child and youth victimization.

Illinois HEALS will enlist experts, service providers, community groups, and other relevant stakeholders to:

- Complete a 15-month strategic planning process resulting in a detailed statewide plan (Phase 1).

- Implement a multisystem statewide effort to improve outcomes for children, youth, and their families (Phase 2).

## Project Objectives

- Identify and promote healing for victims of crime.

- Provide or coordinate prevention and intervention services to youth and families experiencing trauma and victimization.

- Build capacity within communities to meet the needs of youth exposed to violence.

In October 2017, Illinois was awarded a Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth grant from the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice. Illinois is one of only four states designated as a demonstration site for planning and implementing the multi-year grant. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) is the coordinating entity for this project in Illinois.

Through this demonstration project, OVC wants to learn what is needed to bring healthcare, child welfare, justice, and other systems together at a statewide level to coordinate and align efforts to ensure a timely and seamless response to young victims, their families, and caregivers, no matter the system of entry.
