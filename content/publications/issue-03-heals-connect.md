Welcome to the Illinois HEALS CONNECT Newsletter!

The issue features an Illinois HEALS demonstration project update, webinar news, and new resources for practitioners.

## Program Update

Within the Illinois HEALS System of Care Framework, trained and supported natural helpers **Recognize** signs of victimization, knowledgeable and empathic staff **Connect** victims and their families to requested services, and service providers **Engage** victims and their families in trauma-informed and culturally relevant services. Many activities and competencies are required to fully actualize this framework.

The Illinois HEALS demonstration site, Egyptian Health Department, is using this system of care approach in its efforts to meet the needs of child and youth victims of violence and their families. Five resources coordinators will serve the five-county project area - Franklin, Gallatin, Saline, White, and Williamson. Resource coordinators are developing relationships with local schools and conducting scans of existing services for children, youth, and families. The scans will be used to develop and implement the [Integrated Referral and Intake System](https://connectwithiris.org/) (IRIS), a web-based application that eases warm hand-offs and improves communication among partners by streamlining the referral process. IRIS will close the communication loop for referring organizations and provide reliable measures of partner capacity to serve the community.

IRIS also is being implemented in the [Governor's Office of Early Childhood Development Coordinated Intake and Referral Pilots](http://igrowillinois.org/) and several [AOK Networks](http://www.aoknetworks.org/illinois/).

## Illinois HEALS Webinar Series

This winter, Illinois HEALS sponsored a webinar series to introduce approaches that can enhance the way practitioners work with parents. Experts emphasized that professionals are most effective when they enlist parents as partners.

In January, Katie Pohlman and Pattie Leppala of the Midwest PBIS Network presented on engaging families as partners through high-fidelity wraparound. The [Midwest PBIS Network](http://www.midwestpbis.org/materials/wraparound) supports the implementation of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports in state, local, and community agencies throughout the Midwest.

In February, [National Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health's](https://www.ffcmh.org/) Lynda Gargan and Michelle Covington discussed engaging parents and caregivers in program leadership in ways that respect the lived experience and wisdom of families. Their organization offers certification for parents/family peers to provide support to other families who have children with emotional, behavioral, and mental health challenges.

This month's session was led by Deborah Gross and Amie Bettencourt of [The Chicago Parent Program](http://www.chicagoparentprogram.org/). They shared the history of their program, created specifically for and with input from families raising young children in low-income communities. The program is evidence-based, emphasizes positive parenting strategies, and supports parents as experts and the change agents for their families.

## New Resources

[National Child Traumatic Stress Network's New Resource: A Socio-Culturally, Linguistically-Responsive, and Trauma-Informed Approach to Mental Health Interpretation](https://www.nctsn.org/resources/a-socio-culturally-linguistically-responsive-and-trauma-informed-approach-to-mental-health-interpretation) provides mental health clinicians and professional interpreters with information about a trauma-informed approach to mental health interpretation that is socio-culturally and linguistically-responsive to the needs of children and families.

[ECHO Resources](https://www.echotraining.org/resources/) can help educate survivors about trauma and resilience to promote survivor empowerment, resolve individual and community-level trauma, and create safe, stable, nurturing relationships that interrupt the cycle of generational trauma.
