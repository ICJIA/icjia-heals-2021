Welcome to the Illinois HEALS CONNECT Newsletter! This issue features Illinois HEALS grant program updates, technical assistance news, new research, and resources notes.

## NEW IL HEALS PROGRAMS

[ICJIA](https://icjia.illinois.gov) set aside $2.7 million in FFY17 Victims of Crime Act funds to support cross-system projects based on the Illinois HEALS Action Plan. Seventeen applications were received with grant requests totaling $5.7 million. Seven programs were selected for funding totaling about \$2.5 million. The following programs will implement cross-system IL HEALS projects to improve victim identification, connection, and engagement in services:

### Chicago: Catholic Charities

Serving the Back of the Yards and Little Village neighborhoods-communities that are predominately Latinx and lack sufficient services-this program aims to increase service access to young children and their families by providing on-site case management and therapy at partner schools and community agencies. The proposed program also includes connections to other agencies that meet fundamental needs. Systems that are included in the collaboration include education, social services, and grassroots/faith-based groups. Law enforcement agencies and healthcare systems will be engaged when appropriate. Services will be designed to meet the cultural and language needs of the communities served.

### Chicago: Erie Neighborhood House

Direct services, including case management, therapy, and pro bono legal services, will be offered to more than 200 young people and their families through this proposed program. This program will primarily serve Chicago's Southwest Side and adjacent areas and will be staffed to meet the cultural and language needs of area residents. Systems formally engaged in the project include child welfare, education, and victim services. Erie Neighborhood House also will work closely with area health care providers to engage families who seek medical care following victimization.

### Suburban Cook: University of Illinois at Chicago/Village of Park Forest Police Department

This project will bring together law enforcement, schools, and mental health services in the Park Forest community to increase the workforce's ability to recognize children and adolescents impacted by trauma and violence. The program includes an emphasis on developing policies and practices that promote integrated trauma-informed care and specific trainings to aid professionals in connecting youth to care.

### Collar Counties: Lake County Crisis Center

The Lake County Crisis Center project will expand services to the Latinx community by creating a formal cross-system structure to coordinate recognition, connection, and service engagement for child and youth victims. Through expanded existing partnerships and an infusion of additional staff, outreach to five additional schools and community areas with significant Spanish-speaking populations will result in families receiving victim services, case management, therapy, and immigration services.

### Northern: City of Rockford

This project will expand services offered at the Family Peace Center (based on the Family Justice Center model) to provide targeted and community-based case management to victims of crime and connect them to ongoing and intensive clinical therapeutic services and other healing modalities. Funds will enable the center to add a co-located clinical trauma specialist and a case manager to the project to serve child and youth victims and their families.

### Central: Macon County

The project builds on existing Child 1st Center services in the Decatur area by adding therapy for child and youth victims and uses a coalition model to improve community awareness about victimization and resources for children, youth, and families. Law enforcement will be trained to better recognize child and youth victims and to connect them with the Macon County HEALS project for services and support that include active case management.

### Southern: Egyptian Public and Mental Health Department

Serving a largely rural group of 16 counties in southern Illinois that experience disproportionately high rates of child abuse and neglect, the Early Childhood Systems of Care Program will focus on linking and expanding early childhood education and social service cross-system collaboration for child victims under five years old and their families. This collaboration will grow and expand co-location of services and multidisciplinary team approaches while increasing public awareness utilizing the framework of recognizing, connecting, and engaging individuals that have experienced victimization and their families.

## TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER PARTNERSHIP

IL HEALS national technical assistance provider, the [National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges](https://www.ncjfcj.org/) (NCJFCJ), has broadened its pool of expertise with three strategic partner organizations.

[Futures Without Violence](https://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/) is a national health and social justice nonprofit that develops groundbreaking programs, policies, and campaigns to empower individuals and organizations working to end violence against women and children. [The Center for the Study of Social Policy](https://cssp.org/) is a national, non-profit organization that connects community action, public system reform, and policy change to create a racially, economically, and socially just society in which all children, youth, and families thrive. [The Center for Court Innovation's](https://www.courtinnovation.org/) Gender and Family Justice team works with communities interested in creating or expanding civil and criminal legal system responses to violence and victimization, including crimes against children, children's exposure to domestic and community violence, teen dating violence, and commercial sexual exploitation, as well as trauma-informed responses to juvenile and adult defendants.

The Illinois HEALS team is eager to learn from these providers and bring lessons learned back to Illinois.

## PROJECTS & MATERIALS OF INTEREST

### Enhancing Family Court Capacity

Funded by the U.S. Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women, the [Family Court Enhancement Project](https://familycourtenhancementproject.org/) was designed to build the capacity of four court systems in Cook County, Illinois (Chicago), the State of Delaware (all three counties), Hennepin County, Minnesota (Minneapolis), and Multnomah County, Oregon (Portland), to improve custody decision-making in the context of domestic violence.

The NCJFCJ coordinates technical assistance to the four sites through dedicated teams composed of representatives from each of the project's partner organizations, including the Center for Court Innovation and Battered Women's Justice Project. These teams help court systems determine how their procedures, practices, and structures related to custody and visitation can reduce further violence and trauma and enhance victim and child resilience and well-being.

### Trauma-Sensitive Schools Series

Education Week, an on-line weekly e-newsletter for educators, recently published a [five-part series on creating trauma-sensitive schools](https://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/trauma-sensitive-schools/index.html). Each part covers a unique aspect of the long-term process of becoming a trauma-sensitive school.
