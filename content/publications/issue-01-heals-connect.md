Welcome to the Illinois HEALS CONNECT Newsletter! The issue features an overview of the Illinois HEALS program, an innovative approach to service delivery, and a program demonstration project update.

## ILLINOIS HEALS OVERVIEW

Illinois Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems (Illinois HEALS) is a six-year [Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority](https://icjia.illinois.gov) initiative supported by the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime bringing together experts, service providers, community groups, young people and their families, and other stakeholders to implement strategies to identify children, youth, and families impacted by violence in Illinois and connect and engage them with services to facilitate healing.

[Illinois HEALS](/) strives to alleviate the burden of finding services to address victimization by ensuring appropriate care and services are made available to all victims no matter whose door they first enter, whether it is their doctor's office, their school, or the local police station or sheriff's office.

## PROGRAM GOALS

The project will meet the following goals that, together, address the needs of child and youth victims and their families:

- Build a local System of Care (SOC) that meets the needs of individuals, families, and communities by convening local coordinating bodies, securing appropriate funding, and developing policies and practices that further the work.

- Strengthen the abilities of systems within the community to recognize child and youth victims by fostering community awareness and encouraging appropriate screening practices.

- Shore up how systems and the community at large connect young victims and their families to appropriate resources and services through a multidisciplinary team that supports care coordination and facilitates effective referral processes.

- Promote practices that engage young persons who have experienced victimization and their family members in an array of services that are culturally specific and humble, accessible, and relevant by developing the professional workforce and enhancing service capacity and quality.

- Establish a feedback loop between Illinois HEALS staff and SOC and multidisciplinary team members through research activities that explore community needs, inform best-practices, monitor progress and processes, and assess the fidelity of project implementation.

- Improve the statewide response to victimization of children and youth by raising awareness of the impact of victimization and influencing the policies and practices of agencies and organizations that work with children, youth, and their families.

## WHAT IS A SYSTEM OF CARE?

A System of Care (SOC) offers a unique framework that connects youth and their families, patient advocates, and child-serving agencies at the local and state levels into a single coordinated system. SOCs coordinate care for children and youth who are involved in multiple systems and provide them with a broad array of services and supports. This coordination reduces the burden on the family, ensures non-duplication of services and facilitates engagement in services.

The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration supports development of SOCs that focus on a variety of mental health and substance abuse issues.\* System of Care guiding principles include:\*\*

- Youth-guided and family-driven.

- Home and community-based.

- Strengths-based and individualized

- Culturally and linguistically competent.

- Coordinated across systems and services.

- Connected to a natural helping network

- Data-driven and outcome-oriented.

The proven Systems of Care model has been replicated around the county at:

- [New Jersey Children's System of Care](http://www.performcarenj.org/index.aspx)

- [Wraparound Milwaukee](http://wraparoundmke.com/)

- [MassHealth's Children's Behavioral Health Initiative](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/learn-about-cbhi)

## ILLINOIS HEALS DEMONSTRATION SITE

Illinois HEALS Action Plan implementation will be tested and documented in a demonstration site. Criteria include, but are not limited to, high levels of victimization; ability to convene and maintain engagement of a broad array of community stakeholders, practitioners and survivors; experience implementing large community-wide planning processes; and experience managing grant funds.

The first Illinois HEALS demonstration site, housed within [Egyptian Public & Mental Health Department (EHD)](https://egyptian.org/) in Eldorado, will serve Franklin, Gallatin, Saline, White, and Williamson counties. EHD offers Project Connect 2.0, an existing SOC serving children with serious emotional disturbances. The demonstration project will expand services to children, youth, and families who have experienced violence and broaden the program's current service area, enhancing and linking systems of care. EHD's SOC is a national model of coordinated care reflecting the Illinois HEALS guiding principles.

ICJIA and Illinois HEALS staff will provide the technical assistance and research support necessary to achieve the project goals and document lessons learned throughout the process. ICJIA and Illinois HEALS staff will gather information on the SOC model and develop a competitive solicitation to bring SoCs to other Illinois communities.
