Welcome to the Illinois HEALS CONNECT newsletter! This issue features Illinois HEALS program updates, an overview of the Virginia HEALS program, and new resources applicable to serving victims of crime.

## Program Update

Illinois HEALS researchers have been busy collecting and analyzing data, writing survey reports, revamping focus group protocols, and proposing new ways to understand how the Illinois HEALS demonstration site is implementing the Recognize, Connect, and Engage framework in its region. Three internal analyses have been distributed to the demonstration site on findings of the Illinois HEALS Advisory Council survey, program staff survey, and resource coordinator focus group. ICJIA Researchers are also updating the focus group protocol so that it remains informed by the ongoing process evaluation. In the next few months, researchers will meet with program staff, Advisory Council members, and community service providers to discuss programming for children, youth, and families impacted by violence. These conversations will be part of a new data collection effort which will allow HEALS researchers to connect with stakeholders at the demonstration site and garner insight from community members.

ICJIA’s Illinois HEALS Team has welcomed three new team members.

**Leslie Cortez**

## Illinois HEALS Demonstration Site Enters Year 2

As the demonstration site begins its second funding cycle, the staff are collaborating with Illinois HEALS staff at ICJIA and the [National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges](https://www.linkingsystemsofcare.org/) to create 20-minute [Recognize, Connect and Engage](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/illinois-helping-everyone-access-linked-systems-action-plan#a-relational-approach-to-linkages) modules to specifically address victimization and how to appropriately support a victim of a crime. The modules can be added to existing trauma trainings targeted at people and professionals in children’s lives. These models will be designed to enhance existing trauma trainings to give participants a basic understanding of how to recognize victimization and appropriately address it with their clients, how to thoughtfully connect their clients to service and how to engage them in culturally responsive and trauma informed services. The site will continue to serve individuals in downstate Franklin, Gallatin, Saline, White and Williamson counties.

## Cross System Projects

A unique aspect of Illinois HEALS is that ICJIA’s federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding supports local adaptation and implementation of the [Illinois HEALS Action Plan](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/illinois-helping-everyone-access-linked-systems-action-plan). Seven grantees were selected through a competitive notice of funding opportunity. Each grantee is collaborating with at least two systems (e.g schools, law enforcement, social service agencies). [Click here for a list of funded projects](https://ilheals.com/publications/issue-02-heals-connect/) . The projects have adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic by meeting virtually with collaborating agencies and attending virtual trainings, as well as providing telehealth direct services to child, youth and family victims of violence.

## National Partner: Virginia HEALS

<img src="/virginia.png" alt="Virginia HEALS image" style="float: right; max-width: 150px; padding-left: 15px;"/>

Illinois HEALS is funded through a federal Office for Victims of Crime grant, entitled Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth. It is part of a tremendously enriching four-state collaboration, which includes Virginia HEALS.

Federal support for Virginia HEALS began in January 2015 and will conclude in March 2021. In addition to support provided via the cooperative agreement between the [Virginia Department of Social Services](https://www.dss.virginia.gov/) (funded agency) and the [U.S. Office for Victims of Crime](https://ovc.ojp.gov/about), extensive training and technical assistance is provided by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.

Over the last five years, Virginia HEALS has conducted extensive listening tours and resource mapping events across Virginia, using information collected to inform development of the [Screening for Experiences and Strengths (SEAS) tool](https://www.dss.virginia.gov/division/famserv/training/vahe1003/story_html5.html). The tool identifies trauma and victimization experiences and symptoms in children, youth, and transitioning young adults. The Virginia HEALS team then developed a Screening for Experiences and Strengths E-Learning Course on preparing to screen, how to access and administer SEAS, and how to respond to trauma disclosures. SEAS training completion is required to access the screening tool. This report describes the piloting and evaluation of the [screening tool](https://virginiaheals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Virginia-Victimization-Screen-Pilot-and-Evaluation-Report.pdf).

To implement SEAS, Virginia HEALS developed a [Referral and Response Protocol](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:8fd822bc-ed8b-4289-bcb5-62617dd8734f) that provides guidance to agency/organizational leadership and multi-disciplinary teams on supporting successful referrals and referral responses and outlines a distinct process for frontline service providers on linking children, youth, and families to needed services and support. An e-Learning course is available to support the protocol. They have collected all this amazing work in this [Toolkit](https://virginiaheals.com/toolkit/).

As its federal funding comes to an end, Virginia HEALS now works with National Governors Association and the Virginia Office of the Secretary of Health & Human Resources on a new project: The Learning Collaborative, Improving Wellbeing and Success of Children & Families -Addressing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). The project aims to develop and sustain strategies to prevent and mitigate ACEs from a state-level, public policy perspective. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the goals and priorities of the collaborative, and of Virginia’s efforts, shifted to address the most pressing needs of Virginians. What emerged from a series of meetings between Virginia’s Trauma-informed Leadership Team and the NGA was the immediate need to share information across agencies and systems and ensure provision of trauma-informed COVID-responses that supported the many social-emotional and physical needs of children, youth, and frontline service providers.

The Illinois HEALS team has appreciated learning and growing with Virginia HEALS and wishes them the best of luck in their ongoing success.
