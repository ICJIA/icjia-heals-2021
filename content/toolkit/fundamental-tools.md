Once you’ve built the foundation of your SOC, it’s time to add the components that will take your project from your team’s vision to your community’s reality. By carefully and thoughtfully implementing the use of screening tools and protocols, enhancing your network’s capacity to offer quality services for children, you, and young adults who have experienced victimization and trauma, and implementing strategies to prevent revictimization and staff burnout, you will add the final touches to the SOC structure. Prepare to invite the community to connect with the new SOC!

The fundamental approach of IL HEALS is to Recognize, Connect, and Engage. Recognize the need to ask about victimization and notice behavioral cues. Connect by building relationships and linking people to available resources and support. Lastly, engage survivors and their families through culturally-specific, humble, accessible, and relevant services. The tools in this module will help your team develop strategies for implementing your plan and preparing to launch your SOC within this framework.
