As with any project, it is important to take inventory of the successes and missteps that occur during planning and implementation. For example:

- Did the project turn out as expected?

- Has it been more or less successful than we imagined it would be?

- Are there things we should have done differently? Are there things we should start doing differently? Are there things that should be continued or replicated?

- Are there opportunities to expand the project? Opportunities to streamline the project?

- What have we learned that would be helpful to share with others?

After the SOC is created and launched, it is essential for stakeholders and partners to continue to reflect, evaluate, and adjust to ensure that the SOC is continuing to meet the needs of survivors, families, communities, and service providers.

In this section of the Toolshed, you will find resources and tools to conduct research-based needs assessments methods that will allow you continue learning from partners, colleagues, and your community how to best meet the needs of children, youth, and families who have experienced victimization and trauma.
