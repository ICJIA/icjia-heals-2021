Once your SOC has launched, it is time to move into the next phase: maintaining and sustaining. Your SOC will need ongoing attention to survive and thrive.

In this module, you will find information and resources that will help you share your SOCâ€™s successes, explore funding opportunities, strengthen your network, and cultivate new leaders to ensure that your SOC can continue to serve children, youth, and families who have been impacted by victimization and trauma.
