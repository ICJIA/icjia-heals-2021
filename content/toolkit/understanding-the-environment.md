As with any building project, before you begin, you must answer three key questions:

- Who can help me?

- What supplies do I already have?

- What supplies do I need?

  When planning to build a SOC, engage stakeholders and partners to support and inform the initiative, determine which services currently exist to support children and youth impacted by victimization and trauma, and identify current service gaps. Gathering this preliminary information will help guide your next steps and will prevent duplicating efforts and services.
  As you are determining who can and should be part of your SOC, consider the unique strengths and skills stakeholders can offer and how partners can be engaged throughout the course of the project. For example, some stakeholders may have the skills and interest in serving on an advisory committee, while others may prefer to be part of the referral network. Regardless of a stakeholder’s preference, you can tap into their skills and knowledge through effective engagement. The resources provided in this module offer tools and activities that can help you identify stakeholders and engage them in meaningful planning conversations.

  Collectively, you and your partners have a wealth of information about services available for children and youth who have experienced victimization and trauma in your area. Discussions prompted by these resources and activities provide opportunities for collaborators to learn about and share information on their programs and services. The resources in this section will help you to gather and document important information about your community that will be essential for planning next steps.
