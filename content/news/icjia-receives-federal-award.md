**CHICAGO - October 26, 2017** | Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) Executive Director John Maki today announced the agency received a $500,000 federal award to help children and youth suffering from trauma.

The U.S. Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime’s (OVC) Vision 21 Award
will be used to develop a coordinated statewide plan to serve children and youth who
have been directly victimized or exposed to violence in their homes, schools, or
communities.

“As one of just two states that received the Vision 21 award, we are honored that the
Office for Victims of Crime chose to invest in Illinois,” said Executive Director Maki.
Unaddressed trauma can contribute to mental, physical, and developmental consequences
for children and adolescents. While a host of systems exist to respond to these issues,
states are challenged to effectively communicate and collaborate.

This award will bring together a coalition of government agencies, victim service
providers, law enforcement personnel, health services practitioners, educators, and
criminal and juvenile justice stakeholders who will work to strengthen early trauma
identification practices and enhance system responsiveness through a 15-month strategic
planning process.
