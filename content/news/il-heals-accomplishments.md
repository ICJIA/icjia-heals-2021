The Illinois Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems (HEALS) Project concluded on September 30, 2023. Since 2017, Illinois HEALS partners have worked to meet the project’s goal of building collaborative systems that promote healing of children and youth who have experienced victimization and their families. Key accomplishments include:

- Partnerships with Illinois HEALS cross-system sites, including [Egyptian Public Health Department](https://egyptian.org/), the project’s demonstration site, and six other sites. Sites implemented the [Illinois HEALS Action Plan](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/illinois-helping-everyone-access-linked-systems-action-plan), resulting in increased service provision, training for professionals, and utilization of evidence-based practices.

- Development of resources, such as the [Illinois HEALS Toolshed](https://ilheals.com/toolshed-home/), a repository of resources for organizations and communities interested in strengthening collaborative, multi-systemic responses to child and youth victimization and trauma.

- Recommendations for strengthening the victim services workforce and building capacity among Illinois service providers, agencies, and communities.

- Research publications on [child victimization](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/child-and-youth-exposure-to-violence-in-illinois), Illinois HEALS [survey findings](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/how-illinois-service-providers-support-young-victims-of-crime-findings-from-an-illinois-heals-survey), a [thematic analysis](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/provider-reported-challenges-and-opportunities-in-supporting-young-victims-of-crime), and a [project interim report](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/illinois-helping-everyone-access-linked-systems-interim-report/), and a forthcoming demonstration site evaluation report.
