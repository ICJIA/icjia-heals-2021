## Guiding Principles

Illinois HEALS incorporates the Guiding Principles articulated by the Office for Victims of Crime. These principles include:

- **Healing Individuals, Families, and Communities**

  Individuals and families who experience or have been exposed to violence deserve support for healing. Healing includes safety, justice, the opportunity to make positive social-emotional connections, and self-determination. Opportunities for healing occur at all points of contact; healing interventions are accessible, trauma-informed, strength-based, individualized, and gender- and culturally responsive.

- **Linked Systems of Care**

  All systems of care are connected and aspire to maximize collective impact through communication, collaboration, and coordination.

- **Informed Decision Making**

  Linked Systems of Care provide as much information as possible to families and practitioners so that the most targeted, holistic, safe, and effective interventions are available.

## Planning

The strategic planning process—the first phase of the project—began shortly after the funds were awarded. On April 5th, 2018 the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) convened a Leadership Network meeting of senior-level policy makers and subject matter experts in discussions to inform the planning process.

Throughout the spring and summer of 2018, members of the Leadership Network, project staff, and other concerned leaders will document how children and youth victims are identified and their needs addressed. The project will initially explore six domains that represent frequent points of entry for children needing supportive services following an incident of victimization:

Illinois HEALS also conducted a web-based survey from May 1st through June 8th, 2018 to learn about the scope of services available to victims of crime across the state. Analysis of the information will inform recommendations for enhancing the healing process for children, youth and families impacted by crime.

Beginning in May 2018, the Center for Victim Studies at ICJIA will conduct a research project to better understand victims' experiences of harm and contact with providers. The research project received institutional review board (IRB) approval in April and the study will continue throughout the summer and fall. The goal is to identify the needs of child/youth victims and family members/caregivers of young victims. This study will also explore the capacity of systems of care to meet those needs from the perspectives of adults with childhood victimization histories and family members/caregivers of child victims. If you are interested in being a study participant, please complete the brief survey to see if you qualify: Young Victims Study survey

Throughout the summer and fall of 2018, members of the Leadership Network and other stakeholders will review information that is collected and analyses that are conducted to produce an action plan for the state. The action plan, which will be complete in early 2019, will inform an OVC-supported implementation that will occur over the subsequent five years.

## Action Plan

Illinois HEALS will support community-driven pilot projects that incorporate the guiding principles and are committed to creating systems of care for children, youth, and their families who have experienced or been exposed to violence. Projects will vary based on community needs and resources, though each project will incorporate important aspects shown to improve outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.

**Training and support** for members of the community and professionals. Training includes information about the impact of violence on child and adolescent development and the way that trauma can impact adults. Everyone who interacts with youth in a professional capacity—from school and medical staff to faith leaders and police officers—is in a position to put training into practice and intervene with youth in a positive way.

**Multi-Disciplinary Teams** that coordinate services for the community and identify resources that may benefit children, youth, and their families. These groups use system of care principles to increase access to services. There is also a mechanism in place for service providers to work closely to provide comprehensive, holistic support to families with complex needs beyond what the system has the capacity to address.

**Enhanced services**. Most communities in Illinois have some strong service providers who are able to meet many needs in the communities. Many communities also have service gaps because there are insufficient resources to support more providers or retain quality workers. There are also barriers—like transportation issues, hours of operation, or wait lists—to access services that result in less engagement in support for children, youth, and families. Projects will identify ways to address gaps and barriers to increase services available to those impacted by violence.

## Illinois Stakeholders

### Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) was formed in 1983 as a state agency committed to improving the administration of criminal justice. The ICJIA brings together leaders from the justice system and the public to assist in the identification of challenges or barriers that are present within the justice system in Illinois, in an effort to improve efficiency and outcomes for the public. The ICJIA works in several categories to improve aspects of the criminal justice system: Grants Administration, Research and Analysis, Policy and Planning, and Information Systems and Technology. The 25-member board, comprised of state and local officials, as well as members of the public, sets agency priorities, tracks progress of ongoing programs, and monitors the agency’s budget.
