## Webinar Series

Professionals serving children continually seek improved strategies to engage parents and support families. This past winter, the Illinois HEALS initiative sponsored a series of one-hour webinars that introduced practitioners to approaches that can enhance the way they work with parents.

## Research Findings

### Webinar: Victim Informed Strategies for Responding to Young Victims and Families

As part of a 15-month planning process, Illinois HEALS researchers interviewed young adults and caregivers of children and youth impacted by violence to better understand their experiences with service providers and their recommendations for improving responses to facilitate healing. Presenters provide an overview of critical activities during the planning phase, interview findings, and the action plan, all of which can inform researchers and practitioners seeking to develop similar partnerships and those working to strengthen their response to young victims and their families.
