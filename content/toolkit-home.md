## What is a systems of care toolshed versus a toolkit?

IL HEALS Implementation Site Coordinators suggest building on what already exists when creating a [system of care (SOC)](https://ovc.ojp.gov/news/grantee-news/linking-systems-care-children-and-youth). This toolshed guide aims to follow that advice.

When beginning a do-it-yourself project, you may not have all the tools in one toolkit needed to complete the project. You may utilize tools from other toolboxes in your shed or rely on friends, neighbors, or colleagues to lend you the right tool for the job. Or, you may need to invest in a new tool to fit your project’s unique circumstances.

HEALS Toolshed Guide, is informed by lessons learned through the IL HEALS project. The toolshed houses a compilation of tools that have been created by IL HEALS and shares links to resources and toolkits developed by national partners and allied organizations that are experts in creating systems of care and building community collaborations.

The sections of the IL HEALS Toolshed include:
