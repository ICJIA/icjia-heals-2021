Now that you’ve identified people to help you build the SOC and determined the resources your community has and will need, it is time to plan and create the structure of your SOC to support children and youth impacted by victimization and trauma.

SOC coordination takes time and effort. For the SOC to be successful, identifying or hiring a coordinator, or multiple coordinators, is essential. Identifying someone who has the time, energy, and agency support to dedicate to keeping the work going is vital.

Additionally, formalizing how the stakeholders will engage with each other and support the initiative is imperative. Fostering commitment and buy-in requires making participants feel respected and that their time is valued. From facilitating effective meetings to fostering a shared vision and mission, this module will help you build and strengthen the framework for your SOC. Start by setting clear expectations of how your team will work together toward the larger goal of supporting children and youth who have experienced victimization and trauma.
