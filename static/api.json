Five resources coordinators will serve the five-county project area - Franklin, Gallatin, Saline, White, and Williamson. Resource coordinators are developing relationships with local schools and conducting scans of existing services for children, youth, and families. The scans will be used to develop and implement the Integrated Referral and Intake System (IRIS), a web-based application that eases warm hand-offs and improves communication among partners by streamlining the referral process.
